                <p> I aspire to learn as many skills as I can in software development, followed by business administration in
                    my near future. My personal obligation is to contribute to the future of computer functionality and technology
                    algorithms by applying the concepts I’ve cultivated overtime.
                </p>
                <p> Although a day in my life really varies, you’ll usually find me hard at work studying Swift, Python, or JavaScript
                    among other languages and libraries so that I can one day dedicate all of my time to achieving my goals
                    and passions becoming a professional software developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In five years I see myself living in a small apartment in San Fransisco right next to my chosen office, waking up early in
                    the morning each day of the week to work on any exciting new project that I’ll have invested myself into
                    at the time. My biggest desire is a lifestyle revolved around deep working ethics and focus.
                </p>
                My favourite past times are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning to program applications and web apps</li>
                    <li>Reading non-fiction titles</li>
                    <li>Teaching myself new and advanced computer science-related topics (e.g. neural networks, machine learning,
                        optimization, lambda calculus)
                    </li>
                    <li>Meditation and yoga</li>
                    <li>Playing video games</li>
                    <li>Following technology and business news</li>
                </ul>
